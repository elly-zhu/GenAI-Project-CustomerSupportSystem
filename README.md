### Objectives
Build a web-based system that can answer questions about a website using OpenAI API.
 - Allow users to specify a domain and URL to crawl a website.
 - Utilize OpenAI to generate embeddings from the transformed website data.
 - Enable users to ask questions based on the specific website content.
 - Utilize the OpenAI model and the generated embeddings to generate accurate and contextually relevant answers to the user's questions.

### Implementations
There are three implementations for this initiative to showcase the integration in widely adopted formats:
 - Command-based Application
 - Python Flask Application
 - Node.js Application
speed of 
Implementing in different formats highlights versatility and ease of integration. Showcasing command-based, Python Flask, and Node.js applications emphasizes adaptability and accessibility, appealing to a broader audience

     - Please note that the speed of generating the embedding file depends on the rate limit set on the user's OpenAI API account, the user might wait longer during actual local execution.
